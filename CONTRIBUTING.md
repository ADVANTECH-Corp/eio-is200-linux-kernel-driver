## How to Contribute

If you are interested in contributing kernel support or have any issues or feedback regarding the project, please follow the steps below:

1. **Kernel Support Contributions** :

   If you have kernel support that you would like to contribute to this project, we kindly ask you to contact Advantech's sales representatives or Field Application Engineers (FAE) before submitting any changes or pull requests.

## Maintenance Policy

This project follows a maintenance policy aligned with **Ubuntu Long-Term Support (LTS)** versions. Ubuntu LTS releases occur **every two years**, ensuring a stable and reliable platform for long-term use. However, our project updates will typically be **released a few months after** a new Ubuntu LTS version becomes available. This delay allows us to ensure thorough testing and compatibility before official support is provided.

As new LTS versions are released, we will update the project accordingly within a few months of the official Ubuntu release, and support for older versions may be phased out over time.

* **Sales Representatives** : For general inquiries, feature requests, or kernel support.
* **Field Application Engineers (FAE)** : For technical inquiries, issues, and more detailed support.
